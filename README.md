## 🛠️ Tableau Skills Demonstrated

### 📊 Dashboard Design
- Built an **interactive dashboard** bringing together multiple visual views
- Used layout containers, formatting, and tooltips for clarity and usability

### 🔎 Interactivity
- **Filters and slicers** enable users to focus on specific segments of the data
- Interactions are set up for selections and drill-downs

### 📈 Charts and Visual Elements
Included a variety of chart types to convey different analytical angles:
- **Bar charts** to compare categories or metric values
- **Line charts** to show change or trends over time
- **Pie charts** to visualise proportions of a whole
- **Maps** (if applicable) to present geographic relationships visually

## 🧠 Data Storytelling
This dashboard doesn’t just show charts — it tells a story using data. Each view is designed to:
- Highlight meaningful trends or patterns
- Encourage users to explore the data themselves
- Provide insights that a static chart alone wouldn’t reveal
